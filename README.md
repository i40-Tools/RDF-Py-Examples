# SemI40STOLandscape
This repository is initiated for studying, improving and enlarging the landscape of I4.0 standards, based on semantic approach via [Standard Ontology](https://github.com/i40-Tools/StandardOntology). One of the main resources used for enlarging the knowledge base of STO is [DBpedia](http://wiki.dbpedia.org/). It consists of files, information and knowledge established within the master thesis for [Computer Science department of Uni Bonn](https://www.informatik.uni-bonn.de/en).

## Description
Before start, install all required libraries via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Repository consists of:

1) module `Ontology.py` that describes all classes, properties and methods needed for the ontology enriching.

2) corresponding python files used for working with the ontology and DBpedia.

3) Standard Ontology in the Turtle format.

## Code Style
It is advised to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as an environment for Python development. It automatically fetches linting from the library `pylint` helping to develop the code uniformaly.
