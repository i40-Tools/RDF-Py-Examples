# [SemI40STOLandscape](https://github.com/i40-Tools/SemI40STOLandscape)
SemI40STOLandscape is a repository for studying, improving and enlarging the semantic landscape of I4.0 standards based on [Standard Ontology](https://github.com/i40-Tools/StandardOntology). It consists of files, information and knowledge established while working on the master thesis for [Computer Science department of Uni Bonn](https://www.informatik.uni-bonn.de/en). One of the main resources used for enlarging the knowledge base of STO is [DBpedia](http://wiki.dbpedia.org/).

## Description
Before start, install all required libraries via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Repository consists of:

1) Module `Ontology.py` that describes all classes, properties and methods needed for the ontology enriching.

2) Corresponding python files used for working with the ontology and DBpedia.

3) Standard Ontology in the Turtle format.

## Code Style
It is highly recommended to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a code editor for Python development working on this project along with the extension, called `Python`. It automatically fetches linting from the library `pylint` helping to develop the code uniformaly.
